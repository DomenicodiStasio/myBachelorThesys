# Abstract (EN)
## Description of the problem addressed
### The thesis focuses on the design and development of automation software
### a procedural document workflow of the company Ericsson Teconomia S.p.A.
### The problem faced consists in the imbalance of the workload
### within the document workflow, which for various reasons involves a
### slowdown of the process with possible repercussions on the company's productivity.
### The objective of the thesis is to show how a prototype was designed and developed
### capable of automating the process and making the workflow more efficient.
### In particular, we intend to examine the best practices and technologies available for
### implement workflow automation, making access to
### information and simplifying the digital signature process.

## Framing of the paper in the contemporary technical scenario
### The increasingly widespread diffusion of the digitalisation of offices and processes
### business has led to an increasing use of digital signatures for signing
### documents. However, their use must be guaranteed in a security context and
### adequate privacy.
### The following thesis aims to analyze the issues relating to security and
### to the automation of a document workflow with digital signature, examining the
### problems proposed in the internship work carried out and proposing technical solutions for
### improve the efficiency and safety of the process.

## Personal contribution of the candidate to the solution of the described problem
### The work carried out concerns the solution to the problem described and consists of one
### web application capable of interfacing with a company database in a simple way
### to automate the workflow relating to the digital signature of a legal document.
### The proposed solution implements some of the most important features for
### improve the efficiency of the process, ensuring safety and reliability.

## Description of the applicative/experimental contents of the thesis
### The project included a requirements analysis phase, followed by the design of the
### database and the implementation of a web application.
### During the requirements analysis phase, functional and non-functional requirements were determined
### functional in order to best structure the software design.
### The proposed solution involved the use of programming technologies
### front-end and back-end such as JavaScript and PHP and using SQL for creation and
### initial database population.
### The XAMPP application was used for testing and previews of the prototype
### Apache Web Server and MySQL.
